### Basic Setup

Once created, you'll need to configure the basics:
- **Panel Title**: The name of your ticket panel.
- **Panel Channel**: The channel where the "Open Ticket" message and button will be sent.

## Configuration Options

You can customize how tickets behave using the following options:

- **Panel Message**: The content of the embed message that users will see.
- **Channel Naming Style**:
    - `ticket-number`: e.g., `ticket-001`
    - `ticket-username`: e.g., `ticket-john`
- **Thread Mode**: If enabled, tickets will be created as private threads instead of full channels.
- **Use Dropdown**: Users select the ticket type from a dropdown menu instead of clicking buttons.
- **Limit Open Tickets**: Restrict the number of open tickets a single user can have at once.
- **Buttons per row**: If not using a dropdown, select how many buttons appear per row (2-5).

## Ticket Types & Categories

Click **Add Option** to define specific ticket types (e.g., Support, Bug Report).

For each option, you can configure:
- **Label, Emoji, Color**: The appearance of the button or dropdown item.
- **Target Category**: The category where new tickets are created.
- **Archive Category**: The category where closed tickets are moved.
- **Support Role**: Roles that are automatically tagged or added to the ticket.
- **Open/Closed Prefix**: Customize channel names (e.g., `bug-001`).
- **Welcome Message**: The initial message sent inside the ticket (supports vars like `{user}`).

## Transcripts & Deployment

Finally, ensure you don't lose history:
- **Auto create transcript**: Automatically generates and saves a transcript when a ticket is closed.
- **Transcript Channel**: The channel where transcripts are sent.

Once your configuration is complete, click **Send Panel** in the top right corner to deploy it to your server!
